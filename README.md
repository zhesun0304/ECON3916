# ECON3916
# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. It documents my coursework, labs, and applied projects at the intersection of economic theory, statistics, and modern machine learning.

## 👋 About Me

I am an undergraduate **Economics student** with strong quantitative training, currently exploring opportunities in **Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance**.  
My academic focus is on translating economic intuition and causal reasoning into data-driven, reproducible analysis using modern computational tools.

This portfolio reflects my goal of **bridging traditional economic models with contemporary data science methods**.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository contains labs, assignments, and experiments completed as part of **ECON 3916**.

### Course Philosophy: Concept Extension  
Rather than treating machine learning as a black box, this course emphasizes a **concept extension** approach:

- Start with **foundational statistical models** (e.g., OLS regression)
- Extend them using **machine learning techniques** (e.g., Lasso, regularization, cross-validation)
- Compare **causal interpretation** and **predictive performance**
- Understand trade-offs between **explainability and accuracy**

Through this approach, I am learning how to:
- Combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Evaluate models using both **economic reasoning** and **statistical metrics**
- Apply machine learning responsibly in economic contexts
