# 🌎 Guatemala Economic Snapshot  
**Executive Dashboard | World Bank Development Indicators**

## 📈 Real Economic Growth (Real GDP)
**Real GDP exhibits a steady long-run upward trend**, indicating sustained economic expansion rather than short-term volatility. This pattern reflects gradual capital accumulation and labor force growth typical of developing economies. Growth appears largely trend-driven, suggesting remaining constraints in productivity, infrastructure, and human capital.

---

## 🔥 Inflation Dynamics (CPI)
**Inflation is mostly positive but volatile**, with noticeable spikes during certain periods. This behavior reflects exposure to external shocks—such as global commodity prices and exchange-rate pass-through—rather than persistent domestic overheating. The zero reference line highlights asymmetry: inflation surges matter more than mild deflation episodes.

---

## 👥 Labor Market Conditions (Unemployment)
**Unemployment remains relatively low and stable**, a common feature in developing economies with large informal sectors. This stability does not necessarily imply labor market strength, but rather limited social safety nets and high informality, where workers cannot afford prolonged unemployment.

---

## 🏛️ Fiscal Balance (Tax Revenue vs Government Expenditure)
**Government spending consistently exceeds tax revenue**, indicating persistent fiscal deficits. This reflects limited tax capacity alongside high development and social spending needs. The fiscal gap raises concerns about long-run sustainability, particularly during external shocks or tightening global financial conditions.

---

## 🌍 External Sector (Trade Balance)
**Imports exceed exports for most years**, signaling reliance on foreign goods such as capital equipment, energy, and intermediate inputs. While trade deficits are not inherently negative, they imply dependence on foreign financing, remittances, or aid—typical of economies in an industrialization and development phase.

---

## 💰 Savings vs Investment
**Investment often exceeds domestic savings**, revealing a structural savings gap. This gap must be financed externally through foreign direct investment, borrowing, or remittance inflows. The pattern underscores the importance of capital inflows for sustaining economic growth.

## 🧠 Why This Dashboard Matters
**This dashboard integrates growth, stability, fiscal policy, and external balance** into a single executive view. For developing economies like Guatemala, growth alone is insufficient—imbalances in fiscal capacity, trade, and savings critically shape long-run economic sustainability.
