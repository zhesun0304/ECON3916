## 🌍 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

### Objective  
This project applies the **Big Mac Index (“Burgernomics”)** to empirically test the **Law of One Price** by comparing market exchange rates to purchasing power parity (PPP)–implied exchange rates across countries.

---

### Methodology  
- Constructed a structured dataset from **The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index**, representing Big Mac prices across multiple countries  
- Computed **implied PPP exchange rates** by normalizing local Big Mac prices relative to the U.S. benchmark  
- Calculated the **percentage valuation or misalignment** of each currency against the U.S. dollar  
- Interpreted deviations from parity using economic concepts such as **overvaluation**, **undervaluation**, and **arbitrage constraints**

---

### Key Findings  
The analysis reveals systematic deviations from purchasing power parity across currencies.  
For example, **[insert your result here, e.g., “the Norwegian Krone appeared overvalued by X% relative to the U.S. dollar”]**, suggesting that local price levels and nominal exchange rates do not fully adjust to eliminate cross-country price differences.

These results illustrate how real-world frictions—such as transportation costs, non-tradable inputs, market segmentation, and wage differentials—can prevent pure arbitrage from enforcing the Law of One Price, even for a standardized consumer good like the Big Mac.

### Economic Insight  
This exercise demonstrates how a simple, intuitive price index can be used to bridge **theoretical parity conditions** and **empirical data analysis**, highlighting both the usefulness and limitations of PPP as a benchmark for evaluating currency valuation.
